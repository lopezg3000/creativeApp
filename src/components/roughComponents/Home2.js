//             <p>Welcome to Fitness Todo. The site that gives you an opportunity to redefine
//                 yourself. It all starts with nutritious smoothie recipes. I am big on smoothies. I drink one
//                 everyday and let me tell you. The energy boost is just what I need to get me through
//                 the day.</p>
//             <p>Create synergy by also trying our healthy recipes. Even before starting my fitness
//                 goals, I made it my mission to learn to cook. I started off by watching some
//                 videos online and pretty soon my cooking ability just escalated from there. I learned how
//                 to bake salmon and primavera chicken among other things. It has definitely been a lot of fun.</p>
//             <p>Lastly, listen to the self help videos I have put together and change the way you think.
//                 They will help you to achieve more than just your fitness goals.</p>
